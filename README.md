# used jupyter notebooks to test

# but to deploy am using heroku (will try aws later)

# for heroku
[1] create an account on https://signup.heroku.com/account
[2] install the heroku cli and git (if needed): goto terminal and type: brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
* instructions are here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
* you need the cli as on a free heroku account you can only deploy to heroku via git
